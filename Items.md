Items Brainstorm
Items can not be stacked. One item at a time only.
Should there only be one item model and then have the item received randomized or have unique models for each so players can try to go for what they want?
Sandtrap: makes an area on the path “sticky” if contact is made with the ground. Set length, must be visible to all players on the screen so there is a chance to avoid it.
Speed boost: temporarily boosts the players speed for a set period of time. The time period and speed boost percentage will need to be play tested probably.
Projectile to go with the theme of the game: Grants player three projectiles. The projectiles go in a straight path only. If hit the other player will get knocked down.
Magnet: pulls opponent towards player for a very small period of time. Not too long as to make the opponent reach the player from across the screen.
Shockwave: knocks all opponents into the air so they lose contact with the ground and slow a little.
Mine: sets one of the items as a trap. Player that picks this up is knocked down.
Ice: “freezes” over the ground so jumps are harder to make. Player slides so it’s more difficult to judge when to time the jump.
Teleport: swaps player and the opponent in the lead’s position. Could be a bit overpowered so maybe skip this one?
Ghost: phase through obstacles so the player only needs to press forward for a small period of time.
Shakedown: Steal the item of another player. This can be useful but also hurtful. The player will need to hold onto this to steal an item that they want but there is no way of choosing the specific player to steal from.
Shakeup: all player positions in the race are randomized. This item can be overpowered so if we go with this maybe limit it to where it can only be picked up in the first half of  the race. If it can be picked up too close to the end then this can be very unbalanced. However, if this is picked up in the first half the player can choose to use it immediately giving everyone a chance to recover or hold on to it and negate their ability to pick up a different item.
